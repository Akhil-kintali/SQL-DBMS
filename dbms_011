Queries :

1. Get list of all the actors who casted in all the movies having name starting with 'Annie'.

2. Get the top ranked movies directed by Biff Mailbu (i.e fname = "Biff" and lname = "Malibu") and released in the years (1999, 1994, 2003) in the descending order of rank and ascending order of year.

3. For each year find the no_of_movies released in that ye ar. Select year for which average rank of all the movies in that year is greater than the average rank for all movies in the database. Your result should be in the ascending order of year.

4. Get the 10 movies released in the year 2001 whose rank is less than the average rank of all the movies released in that year, when ordered in the descending order of rank.

5. Get 100 movies with male and female actors cast count when sorted in ascending order of id.

6. Get 100 distinct actor ids who are casted in the same movie for more than one role (different role name) when sorted in ascending order of actor id.

7. Find the number of directors with same first name (fname) in the database (consider fname if more than one director have the it).

8. Get all the directors who directed only movies having unique cast more than 100
